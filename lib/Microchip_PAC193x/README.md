# Microchip_PAC193x Arduino_Library

This library is a fork from: http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/PAC193x_Arduino_Library_v1_0_0.zip which only supports 1 channel

This library supports all 4 channels.


The PAC1934 is a four channel power/energy monitor with current sensor amplifier and bus voltage monitors that feed high resolution ADCs.  Digital circuitry performs power calculations and energy accumulation.  The PAC1934 enables energy monitoring with integration periods from 1 ms to up to 36 hours.  Bus voltage, sense resistor voltage, and accumulated proportional power are stored in registers for retrieval by the system master or embedded controller. This library supports all the 4 channels on the PAC1934.  Source: http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/PAC193x_Arduino_Library_v1_0_0.zip
